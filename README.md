# Analyzing-House-Prices-and-Venues-in-Atlanta
If you're interested in k-means, regression, and geospatial visualization, this project is a good place to start. Message me if you have any questions.

Where are some good places to live in Atlanta? Here we create a visualizaion of venue clusters and a model that predicts house prices.
Sources: Zillow, Foursquare API
Methodology: K-means clustering, Regression 

In the end, we were able to locate areas to live by venues using k means clustering, and figure out affordable housing prices at the county level. Using regression, we created a model that can be used to figure out whether a house price is below or above market level, providing confidence in our buying (or selling) decision.
